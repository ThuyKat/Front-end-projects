# CSS Topics Covered

## 1. Flexbox Centering
- Used flexbox properties for centering elements
- Key properties: display: flex, justify-content, align-items

## 2. Background Images & Accessibility
- Implemented background images using CSS
- Added accessibility features:
  - `role="img"` to semantically denote image containers
  - `aria-label` to provide descriptive text for screen readers
  - Important because background images can't use alt text

## 3. Text Alignment Properties
Important notes:
- `text-align: center` centers content within its container
- Container width affects visual appearance:
  - If container has specific width and is not centered, content appears left-aligned on page
  - Content remains centered within its container despite container position
  - Use `margin: 0 auto` to center the container itself

## 4. Figma Tips

- Duplicate design: Copy for editing
- Element selection: cmd + click
- Measure spacing: option + click
